# hello-world
My first repository, for practice, with the tutorial
Howdy!
I'm working to learn programming in order to make more money, have flexibility in where I work, and find that balance of working in a quiet space and working face to face with people. I'm married with three kids and a mortgage.  I live in the suburbs of Dallas and drive almost an hour to work.  Of course, my work location keeps changing.  If I could find something where I could work from anywhere, that would be great.
